# About

This is a collection of material for Shadowdark that is licensed free to use under the Shadowdark License. For now this includes the core monsters, spells and items.

You can find json-data for these materials in the data folder. The `convert.py` command line script can be used to produce output in markdown, html and pdf with various options.

You can find pre-generated outputs in the dist folder. The standalone html file for example can be downloaded and opened directly in the browser needing no connection.

## Usage

The easiest way to use the command line utility is by using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), cloning this repository and just starting it with 

```bash
uv run ./convert.py --help
```

to see the options.

All pre-generated files with images use the smaller token images. If all you want is to change the images used, you can just copy them to the image folder in the folder. This is not possible for the standalone web version.
