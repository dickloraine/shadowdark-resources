## THE WANDERING MERCHANT

![](images/the-wandering-merchant.webp)

_A cheerful merchant who appears to be a hale, middle-aged human man with a handlebar mustache. He wears a white shirt, breeches, and leather apron, and he hauls a towering backpack bursting at the seams. Few know the merchant's true nature and origins, though some theorize he is an immortal being or a god (they are not entirely incorrect). The Wandering Merchant always has something useful, far-flung, or incredible to sell at a reasonable price, and there's no telling when or where he'll show up next..._
