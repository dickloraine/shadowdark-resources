## MEMNON'S BLAZING JAVELIN

_This golden javelin occasionally blinks and wavers, briefly turning into a bolt of lightning._

**Bonus.** +1 javelin. Can only be wielded by a chaotic being. If you also wield *Memnon's Discordant Blade* and *Memnon's Entropic Armor*, it becomes a +3 javelin.

**Benefit.** The javelin always returns to your hand after being thrown. Once per day, when you throw this javelin, you can turn it into lighting as per the *lightning bolt* spell (you do not have to make a spellcasting check).
