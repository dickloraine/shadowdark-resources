## NECROTIC MACE OF WITHERING

_A wrought iron mace tipped with a heavy, screaming skull. Black ichor runs from the skull's eyes when the mace is used to channel necrotic energy._

**Bonus.** +1 mace. Can only be wielded by a chaotic priest.

**Benefit.** While holding the mace, you can turn *cure wounds*  spells you cast into harmful magic that instead inflicts the same amount of damage it would heal.

**Curse.** If you use the mace to cast an inverted *cure wounds*  spell, you are haunted by nightmares that night. You must pass a DC 12 Wisdom check during your next rest or gain no benefit from resting.
