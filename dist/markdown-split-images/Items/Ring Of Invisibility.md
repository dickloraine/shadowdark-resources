## RING OF INVISIBILITY

_A simple, gold band polished to a warm shine._

**Benefit.** Once per day, the ring can cast the *invisibility* spell on you.

**Curse.** There is a cumulative 1% chance each time you rest that your sleep is ruined by apocalyptic nightmares, and you gain no benefit from resting. This resets to a 1% chance each time it triggers.
