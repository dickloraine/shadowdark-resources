## WAND OF UNLIFE

_The knobby bone-finger of a swamp troll steeped in acrid embalming fluid._

**Benefit.** This wand contains the spells *animate dead* and *create undead*.

**Curse.** Each time you use the wand to cast a spell, you temporarily lose 1d4 points of Constitution until you complete a rest. If you reach 0 Constitution from this effect, you die and turn into a zombie.
