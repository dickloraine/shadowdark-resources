## WELL OF MANY WORLDS

_A dark circle of cloth that seems to create a tunnel through the surface it lies upon._

**Benefit.** The *Well of Many Worlds* folds open on a flat surface into a 6-foot wide hole. Creatures can jump into the hole once per day each to be transported to a random plane of existence.
