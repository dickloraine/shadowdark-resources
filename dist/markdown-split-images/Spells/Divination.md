## DIVINATION

_Tier 4, wizard_

**Duration:** Instant

**Range:** Self

You throw the divining bones or peer into the blackness between the stars, seeking a portent.

You can ask the GM one yes or no question. The GM truthfully answers "yes" or "no." 

If you cast this spell more than once in 24 hours, treat a failed spellcasting check for it as a critical failure instead.
