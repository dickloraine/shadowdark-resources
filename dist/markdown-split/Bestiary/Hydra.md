## HYDRA

_A towering, amphibious reptile with a bouquet of snake heads writhing on long necks._

**AC** 15, **HP** 55, **ATK** 1 bite (near) +6 (1d8), **MV** near (swim), **S** +5 **D** +1 **C** +2 **I** -2 **W** +1 **Ch** -2, **AL** N, **LV** 10

**Heads:** Choose how many heads the hydra has. Each is LV 2, AC 15, HP 11, and can make 1 bite attack. A killed head sprouts into two new heads at the start of the hydra's turn unless cauterized beforehand. The hydra's LV is all the heads combined.
