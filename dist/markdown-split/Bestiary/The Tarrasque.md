## THE TARRASQUE

_A colossal, four-legged reptile with crocodilian jaws, amber scales, and a diamond-hard, spiked carapace. It towers overhead like a mountain, able to swallow entire villages in one gulp. The tarrasque hibernates deep in the earth or at the bottom of the sea for centuries, only awakening long enough to fill its vast belly in an indiscriminate rampage of terror and destruction. There is only one tarrasque, and it is the most dreaded creature to walk the earth._
