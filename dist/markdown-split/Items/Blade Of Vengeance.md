## BLADE OF VENGEANCE

_A gray blade with a diamondcut ruby in the pommel. It whistles sharply with each slice._

**Bonus.** +2 bastard sword. Cannot be wielded by undead.

**Benefit.** You have advantage on attacks against undead creatures with this sword. You can use the sword to cast *turn undead* once per day (+4 bonus).

**Personality.** Lawful. Grim, suspicious. Forged as a failsafe against the Witch-Kings if they should fall to darkness, which they did. Demands they be slain.
