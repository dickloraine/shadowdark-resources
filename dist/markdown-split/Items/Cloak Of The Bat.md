## CLOAK OF THE BAT

_A leathery, black cloak that has a ragged hem and a hood with pointed ears._

**Benefit.** You can fly a near distance as your movement while in a shadowy area.

**Curse.** Each time you use the cloak to fly, roll a d20. On a result of 1, you and your gear turn into a small bat for 3 rounds.
