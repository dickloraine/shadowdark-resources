## POTION OF EXTIRPATION

_An acrid, tarry substance in an iron flask with a lead stopper._

**Benefit.** You can pour the potion on one object or creature filling up to a close area. The target is utterly removed from reality and cannot be returned by anything short of a *wish* spell.

**Personality.** Chaotic. Protests loudly while being used and never agrees that the target is the right choice for extirpation.
