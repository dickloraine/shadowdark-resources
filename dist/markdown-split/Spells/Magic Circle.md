## MAGIC CIRCLE

_Tier 3, wizard_

**Duration:** Focus

**Range:** Near

You conjure a circle of runes out to near-sized cube centered on yourself and name a type of creature (for example, demons).

For the spell's duration, creatures of the chosen type cannot attack or cast a hostile spell on anyone inside the circle. The chosen creatures also can't possess, compel, or beguile anyone inside the circle.
