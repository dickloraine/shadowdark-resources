_Tier 2, wizard_

**Duration:** 5 rounds

**Range:** Self

You create a number of illusory duplicates of yourself equal to half your level rounded down (minimum 1). The duplicates surround you and mimic you.

Each time a creature attacks you, the attack misses and causes one of the duplicates to evaporate. If all of the illusions have disappeared, the spell ends.
