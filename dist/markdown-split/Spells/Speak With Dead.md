## SPEAK WITH DEAD

_Tier 3, priest, wizard_

**Duration:** Instant

**Range:** Close

A dead body you touch answers your questions in a distant, wheezing voice.

You can ask the dead body up to three yes or no questions (one at a time). The GM truthfully answers "yes" or "no" to each.

If you cast this spell more than once in 24 hours, treat a failed spellcasting check for it as a critical failure instead.
